# Files

* createJSON.py: Auxiliar script file. Used to map the polygons to the raster files.
* polygonization-VIs-json.py: Main script file. To use it, you need to run it on QGIS terminal.
* new-data-lr.ipynb: Machine-learning regression file. It's recommended to use it with jupyter notebook (<https://jupyter.org/>)
* research-presentation.pdf: Presentation used at the end of the internship. An explanation of all files inside this repository, how they we're created and the results they generate
